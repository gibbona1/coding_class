# coding_class

Course structure:
- 1 hour of coding 101 and python basics
- 1 hour of data science, data manipulation, data sources (csv/excel files, APIs, databases)
- 1 hour of GitHub, version control and good standards and practice. Will likely talk about the feedback and sim here.
- 1 hour of debugging/understanding errors (a little JavaScript, time permitting)
- Maybe a final collaborative piece/mini hackathon (open to ideas here!)
